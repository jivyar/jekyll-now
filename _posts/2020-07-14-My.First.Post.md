title: a venture into the blogosphere
---
I find it very difficult to lay out my thoughts concisely, especially in my academic environment where it seems that mathematical ability is held at a higher regard than linguistic eloquency. I have started this blog as an open space for me to be able to write about the various activities I undertake, and I am excited to share it all here. I hope it can also challenge and improve how I read, understand and ascertain the world I am exposed to.
