title: broke but boujee - an irresponsible spender's guide to being sustainable
---

**As an engineer,** I obviously want to try to be sustainable and produce as little waste as possible. However, as an **engineering student living in London**? It's a thought that seems wild and unattainable. Especially for someone like me, who can't seem to resist a Pretty Little Thing sale, the ease of single-click Amazon Prime and the semi-regular takeaway. 

With a bit of money saved over from months spent in lockdown and the free time to enable research into this area, I decided to see if a London-based student was actually feasibly capable of reducing the amount of waste produced, and with minimal money spent. 

If you're anything like me, keep reading and hopefully we can cut down together.
