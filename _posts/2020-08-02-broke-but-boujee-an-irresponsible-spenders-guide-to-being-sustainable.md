title: Broke, Boujee & Being Sustainable - an irresponsible spender's guide
---

#### or: how to keep spending excessive amounts of money but feel like you're helping the environment so it evens out, right?

**As an engineer,** I obviously want to try to be sustainable and produce as little waste as possible. However, as an **engineering student living in London**? It's a thought that seems wild and unattainable. Especially for someone like me, who can't seem to resist a Pretty Little Thing sale, the ease of single-click Amazon Prime and the semi-regular takeaway. 

With a bit of money saved over from months spent in lockdown and the free time to enable research into this area, I decided to see if a London-based student can feasibly reduce the amount of waste they cause, with minimal expenditure. 

If you're anything like me, keep reading and hopefully we can work on cutting down together.

1. Reusable coffee pods

Picture the scene - Cyber Monday in first year. Its the day before a big exam and Amazon has a huge sale on. The stress and ingrained consumerism amalgamate and you click "Buy" on a Â£30 coffee machine. 'Its cheaper than buying Starbucks everyday', you comfort yourself, while the instant coffee in your cupboard cries silent tears. The sale gave you the hit of serotonin you were desperately seeking at the time, but what you didn't realise is that you'd be purchasing and disposing of single-use plastic coffee pods every few weeks. Over time the guilt of seeing those pods pile up and drip old coffee juice inside your bin gets to you, but the money you spent on this machine makes you feel like you have no other choice but to stay in this circle of expense with no escape.

From this (_completely impersonal_) anecdote, its easy to infer that the waste coffee machines produce is insane, with various sources citing that over 74% of disposable coffee capsules end up in landfill, not to mention the energy consumption from factories producing and distributing them. But fear not! 

The best part of this whole affair is that you can work the frother while the coffee brews and you will feel like an actual barista, which is potentially the biggest seller of this method of using your coffee machine.

It is slightly more time-consuming to go through the process of perfecting using these and the cleaning up afterwards, but its either that or the weight of global warming and pollution on your shoulders - your pick!
