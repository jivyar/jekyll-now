My name is Jivya Rajesh and I am a current engineering satudent at Queen Mary, University of London. I oftentimes find myself pondering the world, its wonders and the meaning behind it all. I have so many fingers in so many pies and so wanted a universal platform for me to be able to share my thoughts, research and experiences freely. Feel free to get in contact if this sounds up your alley at all, all my social media is down below for your perusal.
